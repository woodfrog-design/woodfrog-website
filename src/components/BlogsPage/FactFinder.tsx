                        In the fast-paced manufacturing industry, decision-makers rely on timely and accurate insights to drive productivity and efficiency. Traditionally, teams have depended heavily on data analysts and SQL experts to uncover trends in production, cycle times, sensor data, and defect rates. This dependency slows decision-making and increases costs.

                    <Paragraph>
                        To address this gap, we developed FactFinder, an AI-powered application leveraging large language models (LLMs). FactFinder enables manufacturing professionals to query databases in natural language and instantly access KPIs without technical expertise.
